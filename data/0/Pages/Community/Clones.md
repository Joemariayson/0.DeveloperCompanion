Zero System is designed to be cloned and modified and again cloned and modified. Every clone is capable of exporting assets that may be used by other Zero System clones and Web Applications in general. Types of modifications and exported assets typically fall into categories and we have established some categories to make working with the Zero System community of code and services easier.


## Community Leader Clones

These are clones of Zero System that have chosen to walk their own path in the maintenance of an alternative point of view to other existing *Community Leader Clones*. These clones **continuously choose to stay compatible** with as many other *Community Leader Clones* and their communities as possible without sacrificing their own path. *Community Leader Clones* are lead by **individual thought leaders** who benevolently dictate the technology and community direction to advance their publicly stated motives.

You can become a *Community Leader* by cloning Zero System and integrating it with the technology stack or way of thinking **you have composed and are living and breathing with success for yourself** and want to share with others.


## Community Ambasador Clones

These are clones of Zero System that bridge the gap between the Zero System community and the leadership of other communities of code and people. These clones **continuously choose to stay compatible** with as many *Community Leader Clones* and their communities as possible without sacrificing the unique point of view of the communities they represent.

You can become a *Community Ambasador* if you are leading a community in some way. Simply clone Zero System and start integrating it with your community. If others from your same community want to step up as well you must share the work and responsibility and govern yourself to best represent the community. If you realize that you think differently than others and want to transcend your community you can clone the *Community Ambasador Clone* you used to represent and create your own community.


## Community Adapter Clones

These are clones of Zero System that add functionality to Zero System by providing technological adapters to other projects and services. These clones **continuously choose to stay compatible** with Zero System to provide a rock solid foundation for the entire Zero System community. Anyone can write and publish a community adapter clone simply by cloning Zero System and implementing the adapter code that will allow for declarative control of the external aspect.

## Template Clones

Template clones leverage Zero System to provide pre-built application templates that are pre-integrated with services and ready for modification and deployment.


## Component Clones

Component clones leverage Zero System to provide arbitrary protable components for consumption in arbitrary systems and applications.
